### Project Overview:
This was a 2-week capstone project at the end of Le Wagon’s Data Analytics bootcamp course. The purpose of this project was to explore which factors may be contributing to areas of high and low average health and happiness levels, which differ across the UK. This was a group project, where I worked collaboratively in a team of 4. I pitched the project idea and led the team through the 2-week sprint, successfully delivering the outcome of the project in a Looker Studio dashboard which we presented as a team to the rest of the cohort.
