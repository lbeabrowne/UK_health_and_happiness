  <h1> UK Health & Happiness 🫀😁 🏙️ </h1>

### Project Overview:
This was a 2-week capstone project at the end of Le Wagon’s Data Analytics bootcamp course. The purpose of this project was to explore which factors may be contributing to areas of high and low average health and happiness levels, which differ across the UK. This was a group project, where I worked collaboratively in a team of 4. I pitched the project idea and led the team through the 2-week sprint, successfully delivering the outcome of the project in a Looker Studio dashboard which we presented as a team to the rest of the cohort.

### Tech Stack:
SQL | Python | Stats & ML | Google BigQuery | Google Colab | Looker Studio | Notion | Trello

### Factors Analysed:
- 🏭  Air quality & water pollution
- 🌱  Green spaces: parks, gardens
- 👥  Population
- 🌦️  Weather: temperature, rain, wind speed
- 🐈  Number and cats and dogs owned

### Datasets:
Most datasets were sourced from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), with the exception of the air quality & water pollution dataset which was sourced from Kaggle and an API was used for historical weather data.

- Air quality & water pollution: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/water-and-air-quality?resource=download&select=Cities1.csv

### Project Approach:
- Data cleaning - Google BigQuery, using SQL, while simultaneously exploring on Looker Studio 
- Merging of datasets, paying attention to how location is defined and dates
- Statistical analysis of factors - Google Colab, using Python
- Exploration of machine learning models (including PyCaret library)
- Interactive dashboard on Looker Studio
- Presentation of project insights using dashboard and data-driven storytelling
